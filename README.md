# Stukent Stock Predictor

version 1.2.1

**NOTE:** (1/10/24) This project has been shut down for about two years now. Many people have been reaching out to me asking how to set this up or how to get the data. I'm sorry, but I don't have the time to respond to everyone. I can't explain how to set the project up for yourself, or how I got the data.

## What is this?

This is a stock prediction application I made for my financial literacy class. We use the Stukent Personal Finance simulation, and it has a feature which allows you to invest.

The companies in the simulation have fake names, but they correlate with the stock history of actual companies. If you can find them, you can "predict" what stock values they will have in the future and get rich.

Some of them were quite obvious, like Swoosh Athletics = Nike and Corner Drug Store = CVS. But there are still a few companies I haven't been able to trace back to their real world equivalent.

## How do I use this?

1. Go to <https://stukent-stock-predictor.web.app/>
2. Look at the predicted stock prices
3. Go to Money Management > Investments in Stukent
4. Invest accordingly

This will not work for every iteration of the Stukent Stock Predictor. You can still see which companies are which, but your simulation likely starts on a different date.
